# Biharmonic Plate Solution

This repository implements a numerical solver for the in-plane displacements and stresses of a propped-cantilever rectangular plate subjected to a transverse continuous load.

## Theory

For a linearly elastic plate, the Airy stress function $\Phi(x,y)$ identically satisfies equillibrium and enforces compatibiltiy via the biharmonic equation

$$\nabla^{4}\Phi(x,y)=q(x,y).$$

Stresses are recovered from $\Phi$. In-plane displacements $u(x,y)$ and $v(x,y)$ follow from integrating the plane-stress strains and enforcing shear compatibility.
Clamping is applied weakly via either $\partial v(x,y)/\partial x$ or alternatively $\partial u(x,y)/\partial y$. Thus, clamping is applied either at the horizontal or vertical filament, respectively.

## Running the code

The scripts are written for MATLAB.  To reproduce figures:

```matlab
% at the MATLAB prompt
>> Main
```

`Main.m` constructs `Plate` objects for several slenderness values and calls the plotting routines.  Additional plots such as `plot_displacement_exp` or `plot_stresses_exp` can be enabled in `Main.m`.
